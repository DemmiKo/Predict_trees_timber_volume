      The 1st one examines the relationship between Volume and Height of trees and the 2nd model examines the 
      relationship between Volume, Height and Girth of trees. 
      Three tabs are created. The first two tabs illustate the linear relationship of each model. In both scatter plots the
      user's input values are represented with a different color.
      The last one illustrates the predictions of each model based on user's input
      as well as the R squared value. It is obvious that the second model fits better as its R squared value 
      is much higher than that of the first model." ,
